IMAD5112 ASSIGNMENT 1

My Historical App
In my assignment 1 of introduction to mobile application and development have been asked to create a historical app that one of my friends who is a teacher need for her students to make the subject she is teaching which is History more interesting. This app will help learners know more about the historical legends (artists, singers, presidents, queen, Princesses, anti-racists, ect). In this app students need to enter the age and the app will generate the historical legend who died at that age but the number should be between 20 and 100 years.
I will be using Android Studio to create the historical app and I will be using Kotlin as my coding language. I will start by entering empty activity, then after that I went to my activity-main then went to my design. In my design I started with deleting the “Hellow World” going into my palette then text and dragged the text to the design and go to attributes and change the name of the text to Enter age then I go bag to the design and double click my design then the text will be saved the same name as the one I saved at attributes. I will then go again and drag a number text and place it next to Enter age text. I will add another text to my design and name it My History app, I will again add my button from the palette and name it Generate history. I then dragged another button and then named it cancel. Then I will drag another text view to my design and name it Display results. I will go back my texts and buttons and rename their ID, first text is textView , second text will be ageNumber, third will bw textView2 ,then first button will be btnGenerate then second button is  btnCancel. We will then constrain each text and button to respectful texts, like the first text to the the top so on and so forth.
